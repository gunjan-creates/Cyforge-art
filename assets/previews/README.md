# Preview Thumbnails

Store representative thumbnails or contact sheets for each experiment and workflow. Use these quick-view images to browse results without pulling large renders.

## Guidelines

- Preferred formats: `.jpg` or `.png` at 512 px on the longest edge.
- Keep file sizes under 500 KB.
- Match filenames to the related experiment or workflow (e.g., `2025-11-17_neon-city.jpg`).
- Include a short caption in the corresponding experiment log.
