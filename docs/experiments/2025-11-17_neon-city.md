# Experiment: 2025-11-17 Neon City Dreamscape

## Goal
- Validate the Neon City Dreamscape prompt across variations in weather, crowd density, and hero elements.

## Inputs
- Prompt: `prompts/styles/2025-11-17_neon-city.md`
- Workflow: `workflows/batch/neon_city_batch.py`
- Palette: `assets/palettes/2025-11-17_neon-city.json`
- Model: `SDXL 1.0`
- Sampler: `DPM++ 2M Karras`
- Steps: 35
- CFG Scale: 7.5
- Resolution: 768x512

## Process
- Generated `neon_city_queue.json` via `python workflows/batch/neon_city_batch.py`.
- Imported the queue into ComfyUI using the JSON Queue Loader node.
- Rendered three jobs per weather condition to evaluate consistency.
- Selected top outputs and exported thumbnails to `assets/previews/` (pending upload).

## Results
- Queue file: `workflows/batch/neon_city_queue.json`
- Thumbnails (add when available): `assets/previews/2025-11-17_neon-city_*.jpg`

## Learnings
- `soft rain` variation delivered the best light reflections; `light snowfall` introduced unwanted grain—consider boosting denoise strength.
- Hero element `street vendor stall` needs warmer rim light; adjust prompt or post grade accordingly.
- Next iteration: experiment with camera focal length modifiers and slight fisheye distortion for dynamic framing.
