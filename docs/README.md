# Documentation Hub

Reference notes, experiment logs, and configuration guides that capture the evolving Cyforge Art workflow.

## Structure

- `experiments/` – chronological write-ups of rendering sessions and discoveries
- `setup.md` – environment prerequisites and tooling configuration
- `gallery/` – curated highlights with links to full-resolution renders (optional)

## Usage

- Treat documentation as a lab notebook: record parameters, model versions, and outcomes.
- Capture both successes and dead ends so future iterations avoid repeated pitfalls.
- Cross-reference assets and prompts wherever they are used.
