# Gallery Entry: Mech Ranger Portrait

> Thumbnail placeholder: add `assets/previews/2025-11-17_mech-ranger_main.jpg` once graded renders are ready.

## Summary
- Prompt: `prompts/subjects/2025-11-17_mech-ranger.md`
- Palette: `assets/palettes/2025-11-17_mech-ranger.json`
- Post Workflow: `workflows/post/mech_ranger_grade.py`

## Highlights
- Weathered armor finish pairs well with desert backdrops; edge wear reads clearly after grading.
- Amber visor glow remains readable against darker scenes when exposure compensation is +0.3 EV.
- Snowy ridge variant benefits from the teal accent color to break monotony.

## Next Iterations
- Add ControlNet pose references to stabilize weapon silhouettes.
- Test alternative samplers (Heun, DPM++ SDE) for smoother bokeh.
